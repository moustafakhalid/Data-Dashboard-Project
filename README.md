# Data-Dashboard-Project
In this project, we created visualizations to reveal insights from the US Census Demographic Data set. we created data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. our work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
